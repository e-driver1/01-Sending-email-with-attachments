This language used is python. 

It uses the yagmail, os and dotenv libraries.

The code sends a MSFT word file as an email attachment from a gmail account to a hotmail account.

Improvements to be made:
- Hold the passwords in a key/ passwords manager
- Automate the sending of the email at a certain time per day using a cron job
